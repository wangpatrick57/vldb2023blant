/*
** NOTE 1/22/2021: Up until now, I think we've been doing it wrong, as follows: when counting *actual* L3s between nodes
** that actually have an edge between them in the original graph, it shouldn't matter whether the pair of nodes are in the
** training set (in which case the edge is observed), or the test set (in which case the edge is absent in the training
** set--which DOESN'T CHANGE THE L3 COUNT OF THESE TWO NODES!!!). Thus, if you compare the *distribution* of actual L3
** counts of true edges in the training set, to that of node pairs that are in the training set, the distributions are
** *identical*, as they should be.
**    However, this fact is *not* true of the counts associated with orbit pair 4:11:11; node pairs with observed
** edges have about 1.7x higher 4:11:11 count than node pairs whose edge has been moved to the test set. I think this
** is because I don't delete edges in the sampled graphlet *until* we start looking at its motifs. That's incorrect,
** and your long-ago original Kovacs algorithm was closer: you need to pick a pair of nodes in the sampled *graphlet*,
** and *then* sample the motifs... and if the pair of nodes is an edge, you should delete that edge BEFORE YOU START
** looking at the motifs underneath. Thus, another level of edge deletion has to occur (which only adds to pre-computation):
** you need to loop through all all pairs of nodes at the top-level graphlet, and delete the edge if it's their; and then
** recurse down the motifs but counting *ONLY* the node pair at the top. So in the recursion we need to keep track
** not only of the TopOrdinal, but the Top_u and Top_v who's orbit-pairs we're accumulating, and update the orbit-pairs
** of *only* that node pair as we recurse down. But then there needs to be (k choose 2) top-level calls to the recursive
** motif algorithm.
**
** NOTE 2: The above was 3pm. I wrote all of the below.... but it seems to make results *worse*. Go figure???
