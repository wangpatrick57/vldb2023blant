// A hierarchical binary tree is a binary tree in which the *data* member of each node is itself another binary tree.
// It is best used when each key K at one level has associated with it many sub-keys of a different sort; these sub-keys
// are associated only with K. And so it goes down the hierarchy.
// The hierarchy has a fixed depth, and when you insert or lookup an element, you specify a depth you wish to go,
// and an array of keys with length equal to the depth you're searching.
// For now, to keep things simple, we assume the key is *always* a string, and the data is always a simple foint.
// That way all key operations use strcmp, strdup, and free.
